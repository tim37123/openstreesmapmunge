In particular the following things should be done:
- you should process only 2 types of top level tags: "node" and "way"
- all attributes of "node" and "way" should be turned into regular key/value pairs, except:
    - attributes in the CREATED array should be added under a key "created"
    - attributes for latitude and longitude should be added to a "pos" array,
      for use in geospacial indexing. Make sure the values inside "pos" array are floats
      and not strings. 
- if second level tag "k" value contains problematic characters, it should be ignored
- if second level tag "k" value starts with "addr:", it should be added to a dictionary "address"
- if second level tag "k" value does not start with "addr:", but contains ":", you can process it
  same as any other tag.
- if there is a second ":" that separates the type/direction of a street,
  the tag should be ignored, for example:

<tag k="addr:housenumber" v="5158"/>
<tag k="addr:street" v="North Lincoln Avenue"/>
<tag k="addr:street:name" v="Lincoln"/>
<tag k="addr:street:prefix" v="North"/>
<tag k="addr:street:type" v="Avenue"/>
<tag k="amenity" v="pharmacy"/>

  should be turned into:

{...
"address": {
    "housenumber": 5158,
    "street": "North Lincoln Avenue"
}
"amenity": "pharmacy",
...
}

- for "way" specifically:

  <nd ref="305896090"/>
  <nd ref="1719825889"/>

should be turned into
"node_refs": ["305896090", "1719825889"]
